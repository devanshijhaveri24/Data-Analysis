# Data-Analysis on Kaggle Dataset
Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on which data scientists, data engineers and data analysts spend their majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstartes some common exploratory data analysis methods and techniques using python. I have performed Analysis on the very popular crowd-source Kaggle Platform' data. The Kaggle dataset, which spans two and a half years, is visualised, and valuable insights are extracted. 

# About the dataset
* The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/morriswongch/kaggle-datasets) has been taken from Kaggle itself.
* It consists of the details of the datasets available on Kaggle from January 2016 to July 2018. 
* It includes the dataset sizes, categories to which the dataset belongs, the creator name, download count, view count, votes and much more.

# More info
* The dataset is not clean and hence a lot of pre-processing is carried out. 
* I have initially parsed two columns(categories and votes) of the datasets since they existed as a dictionary.
* The data was then cleaned since there existed null values in the 'categories' column.
* Since both the columns were parsed separately, merging was required.
* Once the dataset was ready, I visualised and brought meaningful insights from the given data.
